CoreOS Nginx Web Cluster
========================

This project contains working files produced alongside the excellent online tutorial series titled 'Getting Started with CoreOS' on DigitalOcean (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-coreos-system-components).

With these files a cluster of CoreOS (https://coreos.com) hosts running Etcd (https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and Fleet (https://github.com/coreos/fleet) have been configured to each serve as an Nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) backend or load balancer.
